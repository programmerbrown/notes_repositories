# Notes on Repositories

Here is a brief review of how I organize my various repositories.

**tutorial_**  :arrow_right: Any repository that begins with *tutorial_* means that this repository is the product of following along a tutorial. The tutorial could be a book, video course, or an article. 

**notes_**  :arrow_right:  Any repository that begins with *notes_** are just notes on a particular topic.

**projects_**  :arrow_right:  Any repository that beginss with *projects_* was a project that was built as a project during General Assembly. 

**sandbox_**  :arrow_right:  Any repository that begins this *sandbox_* is being used to explore particular technologies or programming ideas/concepts in an unstructured fashion.
