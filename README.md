# Notes on Repositories

Here is a brief review of how I organize my various repositories.

| Repo Prefix | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **tutorial_** | Any repository that begins with *tutorial_* means that this repository is the product of following along a tutorial. The tutorial could be a book, video course, or an article. |

| **notes_** | Any repository that begins with *notes_** are just notes on a particular topic. |

| **projects_** | Any repository that beginss with *projects_* was a project that was built as a project during General Assembly. |

| **sandbox_** | Any repository that begins this *sandbox_* is being used to explore particular technologies or programming ideas/concepts in an unstructured fashion. |
